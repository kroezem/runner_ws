# Runner system services

These units run the Foxglove bridge and battery monitor as system services,
independently of the sensor bringup launch stack. They deliberately do not add
the battery node to a perception launch file.

Install the units as symlinks so the tracked copies remain authoritative:

```sh
sudo ln -s /home/matti/runner_ws/services/runner-foxglove.service /etc/systemd/system/runner-foxglove.service
sudo ln -s /home/matti/runner_ws/services/runner-battery.service /etc/systemd/system/runner-battery.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Before enabling either unit, verify that it sources both
`/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` and `/home/matti/runner_ws/install/setup.bash`, and
that the workspace overlay is current.

Enable and start the services manually:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now runner-foxglove.service
sudo systemctl enable --now runner-battery.service
```
